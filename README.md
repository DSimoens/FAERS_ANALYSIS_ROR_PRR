# FAERS Pharmacovigilance Analysis Pipeline

A **Jupyter notebook** to perform pharmacovigilance signal detection using the U.S. FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS). The pipeline calculates pharmacovigilance metrics such as ROR, PRR, RRR, and Haldane's Odds Ratio with 95% confidence intervals for a drugâ€“event combination and exports the results to Excel.

This might contain errors, use at own risk. 

## Downloading the data files

Please download the ASCII file using this link:

[https://fis.fda.gov/extensions/FPD-QDE-FAERS/FPD-QDE-FAERS.html](https://fis.fda.gov/extensions/FPD-QDE-FAERS/FPD-QDE-FAERS.html)

These are the steps you should follow.

1. Download the ASCII ZIP archive
2. Unzip. Find the files `DRUG25Q1.txt` and `REAC25Q1.txt`
3. Create a folder called `data-source` in this repo
4. Put the aforementioned files in this folder

## Setup your runtime environment

Open a terminal pointed to the root folder of this repository.

If you have not done so make a venv using:

```bash
python -m venv ./.venv
```

Activate the vevenv and install the libraries using:

```bash
source ./.venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Now you can either run Jupyter notebook or use vcode with the Jupyter extention.

## Features

Load and clean FAERS DRUG and REAC files across a selected time period.
- Normalize drug names using a provided synonym list.
- Remove duplicates according VigiMatch standards.
- Match adverse events based on a list of synonyms.
- Build contingency table for 2x2 analysis.
- Calculate:
  - **ROR** (Reporting Odds Ratio) + 95% CI
  - **PRR** (Proportional Reporting Ratio) + 95% CI
  - **RRR** (Relative Reporting Ratio) + 95% CI
  - **Haldane's Odds Ratio** + 95% CI
  - **Fisher's Exact Test p-value**
  - **Chi-square and Yates-corrected Chi-square p-values**
- Export detailed results and breakdowns to a multi-sheet Excel file.


## Example of user input

In the first code cell of the nodebook you can change the parameters of the script.

For example:

```python
drug_synonyms = ['DRUGNAME', 'GENERIC DRUG NAME']
event_synonyms = ['nausea ', 'vomiting', 'gastrointestinal symptoms']
```

Run all the cells in order and you should see an Excel file appear in the repository.
